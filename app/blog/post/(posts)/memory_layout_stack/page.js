            <Paragraph>
                The stack grows from the higher to the lower addresses but the data is accessed from lower to higher. 
                This means that when some memory is allocated, it takes memory from the highest free addresses, but when we access the allocated space we use the lowest address as the start. 
                So if we write data in the allocated memory it will be written from the lowest address of the allocated chunk to the higher address
